# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

During the first week of the course, I was unable to attend the Saturday class due to my prior engagement (Graudation) in the Data Science Empowerment program by Correlation One. However, I promptly caught up with the prerequisite requirements and homework to ensure that I was adequately prepared for the course. To achieve this, I took the following measures:

-I created a Gitpod account and installed the Google Chrome extension, which enabled me to access the course material seamlessly.

-I explored the CodeSpaces account, which was conveniently linked to my GitHub account, and observed the availability of Jupyter Notebook as a template. As a proficient user of Jupyter Notebook, I found this to be a positive aspect of the course.

-I created a new AWS account to replace my previous 12-month trial, which had expired, to facilitate my course-related activities.

-I purchased a custom domain, which proved essential in streamlining my course-related tasks.

-I created accounts with Lucid, Honeycomb.io, and Rollbar to fulfill the course requirements, demonstrating my commitment to achieving the course objectives.

-I watched the security and billing considerations videos, and satisfactorily completed the quizzes to ensure I was fully informed of the course expectations.

Although I inadvertently forked instead of using the designated template, resulting in the deletion of my initial repository, I have since restarted the process and remain confident in my readiness for the course.

- In a client-server architecture, the client sends a request for information to the server through a front-end application. The server, located in the back-end, processes the request and sends back the requested information as a response to the client.
